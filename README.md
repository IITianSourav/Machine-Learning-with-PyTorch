# Machine-Learning-with-PyTorch
This is a self study material for Machine Learning using PyTorch.

Before diving into **Machine Learning with PyTorch**, itâ€™s essential to have a strong foundation in several key areas. Hereâ€™s a structured list of prerequisites:

---

## **1. Mathematics Fundamentals**
Machine learning relies heavily on mathematical concepts, so familiarity with the following topics is crucial:

### **Linear Algebra**  
- Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors  
- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inverse, transpose)  
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  

### **Calculus**  
- Derivatives and Partial Derivatives  
- Chain Rule (important for backpropagation)  
- Gradient Descent and Optimization  

### **Probability & Statistics**  
- Probability distributions (Normal, Bernoulli, Poisson)  
- Bayesâ€™ Theorem  
- Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation  
- Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals

## **2. Programming Skills (Python)**
PyTorch is built on Python, so basic to intermediate Python skills are necessary:

- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets)  
- Loops and Conditional Statements  
- Functions and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- List Comprehensions and Lambda Functions  
- File Handling (CSV, JSON, TXT)  

Useful libraries:  
- **NumPy** (for numerical computing)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualization)

## **3. Machine Learning Basics**
Understanding fundamental ML concepts before using PyTorch will help:

- **Supervised Learning** (Regression, Classification)  
- **Unsupervised Learning** (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)  
- **Feature Engineering** (Scaling, Normalization, Encoding)  
- **Evaluation Metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE, F1-Score)  

Familiarity with **Scikit-Learn** can be helpful for ML workflows.

## **4. Deep Learning Concepts**
Since PyTorch is mainly used for deep learning, understanding the following is important:

- **Neural Networks** (Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP)  
- **Activation Functions** (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax)  
- **Loss Functions** (Cross-Entropy, MSE, MAE)  
- **Optimization Algorithms** (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)  
- **Backpropagation & Gradient Descent**  

---

## **5. PyTorch Basics**
Before jumping into ML models, you should learn PyTorch fundamentals:

- **Tensors** (PyTorchâ€™s core data structure)  
- **Tensor Operations** (Reshaping, Slicing, Broadcasting)  
- **Autograd & Computational Graphs**  
- **Building Simple Neural Networks**  
- **Using GPU Acceleration (CUDA)**  

---

## **6. Working with Datasets**
Handling and preprocessing data efficiently is key:

- Loading datasets using **torchvision** and **torchtext**  
- Custom datasets with **torch.utils.data.Dataset**  
- DataLoader for **batch processing**  
- Image processing using **PIL & OpenCV**  

---

## **7. Model Training & Evaluation**
Understanding the process of training ML models with PyTorch:

- Model building using `torch.nn.Module`  
- Training loops (forward pass, loss computation, backward pass)  
- Optimization using `torch.optim`  
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Saving & loading models  

---

## **8. (Optional) Deployment & Advanced Topics**
- **ONNX for model deployment**  
- **TorchScript for model optimization**  
- **Integrating PyTorch with Flask or FastAPI**  
- **Distributed Training with PyTorch Lightning**
